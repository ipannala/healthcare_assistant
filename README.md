# healthcare_assistant
I built a multi-agent healthcare assistant using Autogen-AgentChat and Autogen-Ext (OpenAI). The system dynamically routes user requests - such as retrieving patient information, searching medical literature, updating records, or booking appointments - to specialized agents through a selector router powered by NLP intent classificatiton.
